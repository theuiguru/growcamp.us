  <h3>What is GROW?</h3>
  <p>The objective of G.R.O.W. Ministries is to help women grow in Christ throughout all the stages of their life and have a personal, life-changing relationship with God. This ministry is essential in that it provides a support system for young women while also educating them in the Orthodox faith. The goal of the ministry for 2013 is to further reach out to women by hosting events in different regions throughout the Northeast Diocese. The long term goal is to develop a fellowship among young women, encourage each other spiritually, and hold each other accountable.</p>
