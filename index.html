      <p><b><u>Thoughts from Kochamma</u>:</b></p>
      <p>I am an activist and a visionary rooting my convictions and commitments in the Triune God.  My firm faith that is translated into action derives its motivation and inspiration from the contextual theological reflections from the contexts in which the marginalised communities including my experience. The God who stands with the underside in History, who is witnessed to by generations of those that have tasted and experienced God’s hand in partnership with people who thirst for righteousness,  justice and peace constantly and continuously sustains me. Therefore I have been able to demonstrate in and through my work that it is possible though difficult to bring about a positive change through strategic planning, creative -thinking outside the framework and parameters of accepted norms when required.</p><p>My Commitment is to a vision that believes in the possibility of building a new world with justice, peace and harmony. This compels me to be engaged in acts of liberation and transformation. I believe that I have accomplished this at different levels in different places with an emphasis on intellectual enterprises, Education, passionate Mission and Diakonia that enables to live out the Gospel and communitarian team work.</p><p>My ability to relate well with others and embrace diversity has been expressed through my own life.  I have a good experience of working with many Christian faith denominations and religious groups through my work with CWM and beyond.  I believe in the strength of Ecumenical Solidarity for the true witness of the Christian faith especially in this age of multi-plural contexts.</p>
